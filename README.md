# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction App

Welcome to my *Diabetes Prediction* project!  
This simple but powerful web app helps predict whether a person has diabetes based on common medical check‑up numbers.  
You can use it to test a single patient, upload a batch of data, or just learn about the model behind it.

## 🎯 What does this app do?

- *Single Prediction* – Enter medical values (glucose, BMI, age, etc.) and click a button.  
  The app instantly tells you if the person is likely to have diabetes and shows a probability score.

- *Batch Prediction* – Upload a CSV file with many patient records.  
  The app will add a column saying “Diabetic” or “Not Diabetic” and let you download the results.

- *About & Model Info* – Learn what each medical measurement means and how the model performs.

## 📊 Where does the data come from?

The app uses the *PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset* (provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases).  
It contains real medical records of 768 female patients.

## 🧠 How does it work?

Under the hood, the app uses a *Logistic Regression* model – a popular machine learning algorithm for yes/no predictions.  
The model was trained on 80% of the dataset and tested on the remaining 20%.  
It achieves about *78–80% accuracy*, which is quite good for this type of medical prediction.
